Here comes the pain
I've felt its caress and its kiss
And it's always the same
But soon comes the day
When it sticks out its black tongue at you
And crying and pleading and begging's no use at all
And it's with fat bleeding hearts they scream, damn you
And I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
And I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid

This way comes death
It claws at your heart and your brain
And it rattles your breath
I stood out and looked at the city of vermin and flame
And knew that I'd never see this precious life again

First they say, bless you
Then they all wanna save you
But then the whispering starts when they spare you
And it's with fat bleeding hearts they scream, damn you
And I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
And I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
