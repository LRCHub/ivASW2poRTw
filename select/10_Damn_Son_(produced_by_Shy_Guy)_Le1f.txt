Fresh like Downy, soft like chiffon, damn I'm the bomb, damn I'm the bomb
They be like damn son, damn son, damn
I'm talking like, damn son, damn, where'd you find this?

Where'd you find me? In the cut, nicely
I'm sipping ice tea, doing it right like Spike Lee
Slap me, inappropriate, I'm heavy like that opiate
We up in the cut and the bouncers don't care that we smoking it
Hit you with the nice shades, smoke screen cover
Fuck it up like Nancy 'cause we're half boxing
Put them like it's chop sticks with some chilly on top
I'm selling then I got this, go and wash your arm pits
Stank like you just came from the rave that I slayed
When you slave to every single rhythm that I play
Soap and hot water, get the fuck away
You gonna smell like you ain't even showered in days
What does my love smell like
Musk and ambrosia, right?
I'm that essential type, tell me what scent you like
I don't mean to mess with your plans but your man looking at me like he wanna bromance
I make it so Arial, he's looking so Comic Sans, damn I'm honey ham

My bass bangs like streams flow, my dreams, aquamarine glow
These hoes sink, my teams know size me with that hydro
If you know what I know then you roll what I roll
Let's roll up these spliffs, when I dip you dip you dip

Fresh like Downy, soft like chiffon, damn I'm the bomb, damn I'm the bomb
They be like damn son, damn son, damn
I'm talking like, damn son, damn, where'd you find this?

Let's get fermented, that's some shit I like to do
I'm spending like that new-new, I'm so black that I'm a new blue
Benjy bought them both, cases, sexy cue, cool
Catch me deep up in this picture, floating up some new hues
These basic bitches are overruled, looking way too cool for the old school
That's proof that your boy is the truth
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I'm t-low with that music that matters, it means I must have to go Ciroc
From a glittery blizzard you whipped it, I'm soft, baby, like a baby's ass
Egyptian cotton, finer silk touches, plus I'm too cool but they offer extra magic
I guess you got caught up in the web like a treasure
I thought you knew how I do, it's whatever

My bass bangs like streams flow, my dreams, aquamarine glow
These hoes sink, my teams know size me with that hydro
If you know what I know then you roll what I roll
Let's roll up these spliffs, when I dip you dip you dip

Fresh like Downy, soft like chiffon, damn I'm the bomb, damn I'm the bomb
They be like damn son, damn son, damn
I'm talking like, damn son, damn, where'd you find this?
Fresh like Downy, soft like chiffon, damn I'm the bomb, damn I'm the bomb

Fresh like Downy, soft like chiffon, damn I'm the bomb, damn I'm the bomb
